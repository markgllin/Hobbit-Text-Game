# Hobbit-Text-Game
First major programming project coded in Python from 3(?) years ago.

This project is a text based game following the storyline of the Hobbit, specifically the scene where Bilbo Baggins is about to enter the cave guarded by Smaug.

The goal of the game is to collect as much gold as possible whilst avoiding Smaug's fire.

Objects:
	H = Player
	# = Walls
	t = Gold
	* = fire

Controls:
	Use the number pad (0-9) to move. 5 - stay at current position. All other numbers moves the player ('H') relative to where it is to the number '5' e.g. '9' moves the player one position up+right while '2' moves player one position down.

Modes:
	Debug mode can be enabled by entering '-1' when prompted to move player.Debug mode translates to 'godmode'.

Issues/Errors:
	This was my first (major) programming project and thus, does not have any error catching and/or proper coding etiquette.
